<strong>Breaking the Word Bank: Measurement and Effects of Bank Level Uncertainty</a></strong><br><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>I am a climate scientist exploring carbon-climate interactions and how they change under anthropogenic influence. I am interested in providing more robust projections of the Earth's future climate, using climate models and a variety of data analysis tools.
<br>
The primary focus of my work is addressing the question: how much CO2 can we emit in total, before a given global mean temperature level is reached? And how to quantify the uncertainties in carbon budgets?</p>
